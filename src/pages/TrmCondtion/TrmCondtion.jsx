<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >17.2 You cannot make wagers exceeding your Account balance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >17.3 Once a bet has been placed and confirmed, a user cannot change or cancel a bet. It is therefore in the user’s interest to ensure that all details of their bet are correct before placing a bet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >17.4 Before an event starts, zetto.in reserves, at its own discretion, the right to void or cancel part or whole of a bet even after its acceptance without providing any reason to the user. After the event start, zetto.in reserves, at its own discretion, the right to void or cancel part or whole of a bet, even after its acceptance if there is a valid reason for this, such as: - a mistake in the wording (palpable error) of the event, odds or starting time; - the user attempt to bypass zetto.in limits (potential payout) and risk management by placing multiple, identical or similar bets or opening multiple Accounts; - the user is getting an advantage of any public announcement or secret information he has access to that determines the outcome of the bet; - the user combines related bets; - the user is actively participating in the event, e.g. as a Player, Referee, Manager or has direct or indirect relationship with events participants; - Website suffers a technical error offering wrong odds or events; - any other valid reason duly communicated to the user upon request.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >17.5. zetto.in reserves the right to cancel all bets of an event, if there is any change regarding the venue of the event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >17.6 zetto.in reserves the right to cancel all bets if there are radical changes in the circumstances of an event such as the length of playing time, the distance in a race speed or the number of periods, etc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >17.7 Winnings will be credited to the user Account following confirmation of the final result.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >17.8 The outcome of a market is settled once this is determined. Zetto.in takes the right to settle the game results in case a market is not determined earlier in the game. This rule works in terms of the normal duration of the match being concluded and if no conditions are stated in the market description on the Website. For example: Example 1: Match-winner 1X2 market of an event is determined after the end of the normal duration (regular time) of the event. Football (Soccer) 1x2 Match Winner is determined after the 90 min, including any extra minutes called by the referee of the match as “normal duration”. When the game is played in Overtime (the regular time cannot determine the winner), all markets state that this is a subject to pay “include overtime” after completion of the game. If there are any penalty kicks (or other decisive moments) they’re not taken into consideration, unless another stated in the market. If the beginning of the game is delayed for whatever reasons, the event can be kept open and all bets can remain open 48 hours from the official start time. Nevertheless, zetto.in reserves the right to void such bets on its direction and refund the Users’ stakes back. All bets can remain open and be calculated due to the game results by the decision of zetto.in when the organizer continues the abandoned event within 48 hours after starting time. In case the abandoned event does not continue with the decision of the organizer within 48 hours after its starting, zetto.in will settle all determined markets that were completed on the pitch. In addition, zetto.in will cancel another and refund the stakes to players. There are exceptions to the general rule: The 48 hours rule is not supported in the Tennis games. All bets are available until the referee or official representative determines the winner. Nevertheless, there are cases in which a player retires. In this situation, all markets that are determined on the court are settled accordingly and all the rest declared void and stakes returned to players. If there are any doubts about the retirement of a player before the last point is concluded, the market of the match winner is canceled. Nevertheless, all markets that relate to the specific sets or games that are determined, are settled accordingly. Baseball games. The 48 hours rule is supported. When two teams are playing 2 games in a row they are considered as Game 1 and Game 2 and will be settled as chronologically played with all bets valid. For the avoidance of doubt, if Team A plays Team B twice, the result of Game 1 will count for bets offered on Game 1 as originally scheduled and the result of Game 2 will count for bets offered on Game 2, as originally scheduled. The 48 hours rule is valid. (e.g. if a football match is abandoned in the second half, the markets of the first half will be settled normally). (e.g. in the example above, the markets of the second match have not been decided) will be void and stakes will be refunded to customers.</span></p></div></div>
